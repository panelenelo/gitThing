"git log" to see commit list
"git reflog" same but more detailed

"git restore" go back to commit, ignoring untracked changes

"git reset --soft [commit hash]" to go back to a previous previous commit but
keeping files

"git reset --mixed [commit hash]" same as soft but the files are untracked

"git reset --hard [commit hash]" go back to previous commit eliminating all
the files

"git rm --cached -r [folder]" used to stop tracking a certain folder or file.
Ex:If i commited a large folder that i forgot to include in the .gitignore and i dont want to send it to the remote repository.
